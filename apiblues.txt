“Testin’ the API Blues”

(A bluesy rock jam—think B.B. King meets DevOps! 🎸🖥️)
[Verse 1]
Well, I wrote some code, thought I did it right,
Endpoint’s looking solid, yeah, it’s clean and tight.
I ran my test suite, thought I’d win the fight,
But the console said “500?!” …Man, that ain’t right!

[Chorus]
🎶 Ohhh, I got the testin’ the API blues,
Postman’s cryin’, logs are lyin’, I don’t know what to do!
Stack Overflow ain’t helpin’, my brain’s about to lose—
Ohhh, I got the testin’ the API blues! 🎶

[Verse 2]
Tried to send a payload, but the server said “Nah,”
Checked my headers twice, even asked my Ma!
Docs say “Use OAuth”—man, I gave it a shot,
Now I’m stuck in a loop… this is not what I thought!

[Pre-Chorus]
🔍 Check the response, check the stack,
🛠️ Change the timeout, roll it back!
🔄 Debug the body, tweak the key…
🚨 Why the heck’s it returnin’ HTML to me?!

[Chorus]
🎶 Ohhh, I got the testin’ the API blues,
Requests keep failing, patience sailing, I’m about to break some news!
“Boss, we need more time,” but he says, “Yeah, right!”
So now I’m chuggin’ coffee at 2 AM tonight… 🎶

[Bridge]
Swagger says one thing, but the backend lies,
“Expected an object”—what a nice surprise!
Tried it in cURL, tried it in Node,
Still gettin’ errors, man, I might explode! 💥

[Outro]
Well, I pushed a fix, and I held my breath,
Ran the tests again… oh Lord, it passed!
I danced in my chair, thought I’d finally won,
But wait… QA just found another one. 😱

🎶 Ohhh, I got the testin’ the API blues! 🎶
