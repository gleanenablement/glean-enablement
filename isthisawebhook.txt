“Indexing APIs (Oh No, Oh Yes!)”

(To the tune of a country-rock jam—think Johnny Cash meets DevOps!)

[Verse 1]
Well, I sat down at my laptop, coffee in my hand,
Got a ticket from my PM, said, “Hey, go be the man!”
They want real-time data, they want instant search,
So now I’m knee-deep in docs and JSON dirt.

[Chorus]
🎶 Oh no, oh yes, gotta index this API mess!
Postman’s crashing, auth ain’t passing, why’s this rate limit harassing?!
Oh no, oh yes, just one more endpoint, I confess,
But if it fails, I swear I’m done—
Gonna switch careers and live in the sun! 🎶

[Verse 2]
First, I check the schema—man, it’s kinda whack,
Fifty nested objects? Oh, my brain’s off track!
I ask the backend team, but they just say, “LOL,”
Now I’m staring at Swagger, feelin’ unwell.

[Pre-Chorus]
I map the fields, I clean the text,
I pray this won’t become a wreck,
Then push to Glean, refresh the feed—
Oh wait… there’s one more bug to read!

[Chorus]
🎶 Oh no, oh yes, gotta index this API mess!
Docs outdated, boss frustrated, webhook’s dead and I’m devastated!
Oh no, oh yes, gotta debug just like the rest,
At this rate, I might go insane—
Or at least start drinking again! 🎶

[Bridge]
Oooooh, the logs are full of warnings,
Oooooh, it failed again this morning,
But hey, look, the data’s flowing!
It’s live! It’s fast! My code is glowing!

[Outro]
Now search is working, boss gives a cheer,
Glean’s indexing fine, the data’s all here!
I take a deep breath, it’s finally done…
Oh wait—new API just dropped?!! 😱

🎶 Oh no, oh yes… guess I’ll clean up this API mess! 🎶
